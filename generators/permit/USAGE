Description:
  The permit generator creates the authorization and role models, as well as the 
  migration and an initializer.

  You can optionally pass in different names for the authorization, role, and 
  person class that you want to use. Changing the value for Person will not 
  alter any existing models, but will be used to generate the proper foreign-key 
  in the migration.

  script/generate permit [Person [Authorization [Role]]]

  If you don't want to use named authorizations, and only want to generate the 
  initializer pass in the --init-only option. You can optionally pass the name
  of the class that represents an authenticated user and the generator will set
  the name of the current_* method to use to retrieve the subject for
  authorization.

  script/generate permit [Person] --init-only

Example:
  script/generate permit

  This will create:
    Model:       app/models/authorization.rb
    Model:       app/models/role.rb
    Migration:   db/migrate/xxx_create_permit_structure.rb
    Initializer: config/initializers/permit.rb

  script/generate permit Employee Access Job

  This will create:
    Model:       app/models/access.rb
    Model:       app/models/job.rb
    Migration:   db/migrate/xxx_create_permit_structure.rb
    Initializer: config/initializers/permit.rb

  script/generate permit --init-only

  This will create:
    Initializer: config/initializers/permit.rb
